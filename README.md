SBA 319: 

## Inspiration
Mongoose application data is from one of my favorite games: Stardew Valley. 

## Collections
Three data collections; one for seasons with single and multiple crops with festivals that occur during that season, crops data with the description, how much it cost, how many days till harvest, and selling price. The last collection is type of animals you can raise on the farm, the requirements needed and what they produce.

## Functionality and Reflection 
Users are able to get all data from each, or individual season, crop, or animal. Users can also add Winter because its missing or delete a crop.
If given more time I'd work on the frontend and add photos as well as add more info. Note to self for the future: don't forget to check spelling and routes.
